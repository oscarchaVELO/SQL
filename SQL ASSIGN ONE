/*
Assignment 1 - Creating a Simple Query (these are the same instructions as in Canvas)

PURPOSE:

Knowledge:

    o Understand how data is stored in relational database tables
    o Understand the mechanics of completing assignments for this class

Skills:

    o Outside of class, access a computer that has SQL Server loaded on it
    o Interpret questions to understand how to answer the questions
    o Write SQL queries to answer questions by retrieving data from database tables

TASK:

    1. Download the following SQL file and rename it Xxxxx-SQL-Assignment-01, where Xxxxx is your last and first name. 
	For example, I would rename this file CharleneCheng-SQL-Assignment-01.sql.

		Xxxxx-SQL-Assignment-01.sql
		
    2. Open the file in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

    3. Add your SQL code in the space provided below each question. The questions are written as comments so they will not execute in SQL Server. 

    4. Proofread your document to make sure all questions are answered completely and that it is easy to distinguish your responses from the questions on the page.

    5. Return to this assignment page, attach your completed file, and submit.

 

CRITERIA:

    o Answer all the questions
    o If you do not understand a question, did you ask for help from the teacher, a classmate, the Discussion board, or a tutor?
    o Your answer/query is in the right place underneath the question
    o Your answer/query is not commented out
    o Your answer/query executes without an error
    o You have renamed the file as specified above and submitted it via Canvas
    o If you cannot complete the assignment, did you communicate with the teacher (before the due date) so that he/she/they understands your situation?

/*	
    You are to develop SQL statements for each task listed. You should type your SQL statements under each task.
	The fields' names are written as if a person is asking you for the report. You will need to look at the data
	and understand that list price is in the ListPrice field, for example.
	Add comments to describe your reasoning when you are in doubt about something. 


    For this assignment, we will use the AdventureWorksLT2012 database. We tell SQL Server which database 
    to use via the USE statement.

    Do not remove the USE statement. 
*/

USE AdventureWorksLT2012;


--1.	Write a SQL statement that pulls all of the records from the AdventureWorksLT Product table. 
--      I have answered the first question to show you the format I expect. 

SELECT *
FROM SalesLT.Product;




--2.	Write a SQL statement that pulls all of the records from the AdventureWorksLT Product table, 
--		but show only the ProductID, Name, ProductNumber, and ListPrice.
SELECT ProductID, Name, ProductNumber, ListPrice
FROM SalesLT.Product;






--3.	Write a SQL statement that pulls all of the records from the AdventureWorksLT Product table, 
--		but show only the ProductID, Name, and ListPrice, 
--		and sort by Name in ascending order.
SELECT ProductID, Name, ListPrice
FROM SalesLT.Product Order BY Name ASC;




--4.	Write a SQL statement that pulls all of the records from the AdventureWorksLT Product table, 
--		but show only the ProductID, Name, ProductNumber, and ListPrice, 
--		and sort by ListPrice in descending order. 
SELECT ProductID, Name, ProductNumber, ListPrice
FROM SalesLT.Product Order BY ListPrice DESC;





--5a.	Write a SQL statement that pulls all of the records from the AdventureWorksLT ProductCategory table.
SELECT *
FROM SalesLT.ProductCategory;






--5b.   Explain how records 1-4 in the table differ from the other records, and explain their purpose:
--      Include your explanation below inside the comment symbols /* and */

/***************************
 Records 1-4 have a null value in the ParentProductCetgoryID section. Null means that slot has no value. IT IS NOT A ZERO!!! It was left blank for further purposes.
***************************/



--6a.	Write a SQL statement that pulls all of the records from the AdventureWorksLT SalesOrderHeader table.
SELECT *
FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader;




--6b.	Write a SQL statement that pulls all of the records from the AdventureWorksLT SalesOrderDetail table.
SELECT *
FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail;




--6c.	Explain how you would add records to the AdventureWorksLT database for the following scenario:
--
--			An existing customer places an order for 3 distinct existing products, 
--			(i.e. not a quantity of 3 of one single product).

--
--		In your explanation, indicate which tables would require new records, and the number of records.

/***************************
 Nothing in the SalesProduct would be altered since these are existing products. In the SalesProductCategory, Everything would stay the same unless a price was changed for an item. 
 The Sales Header table would require a new ID for the date placed, quanity, IDs for the new order and its detail. For the Sales Header. Almost evrything is changing but the account number, CustomerId, ship address,
 Bill address, and Credit card.
 Those columns were filled out when the account was made however, when the new order was placed, the order total, tax, ship date, etc changed due to the new order and how all columns have to be added becuse it was placed.
 Many would require updated/new records but it dpends on things that the customer may want, he/she may choose the same shipping method they used last time, or use a new credit card.
